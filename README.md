# Hey, I'm Anastasia 👩‍💻

Python backend engineer building Flask microservices, wrangling data with Pandas, and occasionally yelling at cloud bills.

## 🔧 Tech I use (and like):
Python, Flask, Flask-RESTful, Flask-Smorest, Redis, Pandas, Docker, PostgreSQL, MySQL, AWS, GCP, Git, CI/CD, BeautifulSoup

## ☁️ What I actually do:
- Ship microservices that don’t crash (much)
- Clean messy data like it’s my job (it is)
- Optimize things so cloud bills hurt a little less
- Write APIs and document them like a decent human (Swagger ftw)
- Catch bugs with custom exceptions before they catch me

## 🧪 Currently:
- Making APIs faster  
- Teaching junior devs how not to hate Flask  
- Scraping stuff (legally)
